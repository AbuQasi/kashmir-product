    Kashmir is a region located in South Asia, known for its stunning natural beauty and complex political history.</li> <li>It lies primarily in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent and is divided among three countries </li>
<ol>
  <li>**India**: Controls the Jammu and Kashmir Union Territory and Ladakh Union Territory.</li>
  <li>**Pakistan**: Controls the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan regions.</li>
  <li> **China**: Controls the Aksai Chin area, which India also claims as part of its territory. </li></ol>
  
  <ul><li>
   The region has been a point of contention and conflict between India, Pakistan, and China for decades.</li> <li>This dispute originated from the partition of British India in 1947, which led to the creation of India and Pakistan and left the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir with the decision of joining either country. </li><li>The choice led to several wars and ongoing tensions between the involved nations.</li>
  
  <li>The situation in Kashmir involves issues of bi territorial claims, national identity, and human rights,<br> and continues to be a significant and sensitive geopolitical issue in South Asia.</li></p>
